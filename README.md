# MonkeyDo Landing Page - TODO & Strategy

## üîí Repository Privacy

**TODO**: Make this repository private so commits and development work aren't publicly visible.

## üìä Implementation TODO

### Phase 1: Immediate Changes
- [ ] Replace waitlist with "Start Building - It's Free"
- [ ] Add PostHog analytics
- [ ] Track: Button clicks, scroll depth, time on page
- [ ] A/B test: "Start Free" vs "Book Demo" vs "Get Early Access"

### Phase 2: Fake Door Testing
- [ ] Build simple onboarding flow (3 steps max)
- [ ] Collect:
  - Use case (what will you automate?)
  - Team size
  - Current tools they use
  - Price they'd pay
- [ ] Show: "Great! You're #X in line. We'll onboard you within 48 hours"

### Phase 3: Price Validation
- [ ] Test pricing tiers:
  - Hobby: $29/mo
  - Pro: $99/mo
  - Team: $299/mo
- [ ] Offer: "Lock in Founder's pricing - 50% off forever"
- [ ] Don't charge yet, but get card details

## üìù Original Question

> We shouldn't be redirecting them to a waitlist, they should be going directly to our product. Ahead of the product we need to measure stuff, do we measure posthog, well we should do that, but we should have a "REAL cta", how do people do this?
> 
> I guess you can write your answer here. We want VAPOR TESTING, not "WAITLIST TESTING"? Maybe? How have successful landing pages figured this out in the past?

## üí° Answer: How Successful Landing Pages Do Vapor Testing

### The Problem with Waitlists vs. Real CTAs

### The Problem with Waitlists
- **Low commitment**: Email is free, doesn't validate real purchase intent
- **No price sensitivity data**: Can't test what people will actually pay
- **Weak signal**: 1000 emails ‚â† 1000 customers (typical conversion: 2-5%)

## üí° Vapor Testing Strategies Used by Successful Startups

### 1. **"Start Free Trial" ‚Üí Fake Door Test**
- CTA: "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started"
- Leads to: "We're at capacity! Join priority access"
- Measures: Real intent to start using product
- Examples: Early Slack, Superhuman

### 2. **"Buy Now" ‚Üí Pre-order/Early Access**
- CTA: "Get Early Access - $X/mo"
- Leads to: Payment form ‚Üí "You're in! We'll charge when ready"
- Measures: Actual willingness to pay
- Examples: Buffer (validated at $5/mo before building)

### 3. **"Book Demo" ‚Üí Calendar Booking**
- CTA: "Book Your Demo"
- Leads to: Calendly ‚Üí Manual demo or "We'll contact you"
- Measures: B2B sales readiness
- Examples: Most B2B SaaS

### 4. **Tiered Commitment Testing**
```
Level 1: Join Waitlist (email)
Level 2: Reserve Spot ($1 hold)
Level 3: Founder's Price ($X/mo locked in)
```
- Measures: Commitment gradient
- Examples: Tesla Cybertruck, many crowdfunded products

## üî¨ Metrics to Track

### Vanity Metrics (ignore these)
- Page views
- Email signups without context
- Social shares

### Real Metrics (focus here)
- **Intent Rate**: Clicks on primary CTA / Unique visitors
- **Completion Rate**: Finished fake door flow / Started flow
- **Price Acceptance**: Entered payment info / Saw pricing
- **Qualified Leads**: Matches ICP / Total leads

## üöÄ Recommended Approach for MonkeyDo

### Option A: "Start Automating Now" (Recommended)
1. CTA: "Start Automating - It's Free"
2. Click ‚Üí 3-step wizard:
   - Upload/describe your task
   - See mock automation preview
   - "Your automation is being built! Get access in 24h"
3. Follow up with personal email
4. Measure: Upload rate, task complexity, engagement

### Option B: "See Your Price"
1. CTA: "See How Much You'll Save"
2. Click ‚Üí Calculator:
   - Hours spent on task
   - Frequency
   - Shows ROI + monthly price
3. "Lock in this price" ‚Üí Payment details
4. Measure: Calculator completion, price acceptance

### Option C: "Book a Monkey Training"
1. CTA: "Book Your Monkey Training"
2. Click ‚Üí Calendly for 15-min demo
3. Manual demos for learning
4. Measure: Show rate, close rate

## üìà Success Examples

- **Dropbox**: Used a video demo + "Get Early Access" (not waitlist)
- **Buffer**: Showed pricing immediately, validated willingness to pay
- **Airbnb**: Posted fake listings to test demand
- **Groupon**: Manually fulfilled first deals (WordPress blog + PDFs)
- **Zappos**: Took orders, bought from stores, shipped manually

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Today**: Add PostHog, start tracking current funnel
2. **This Week**: Replace waitlist with fake door test
3. **Next Week**: Analyze data, iterate on CTA/flow
4. **Goal**: 100 people who click "Start" + complete flow = validation

## üí≠ Key Questions to Answer

1. Will people start an automation flow? (intent)
2. What tasks do they want to automate? (use case)
3. How much would they pay? (pricing)
4. What's stopping them? (objections)

## üõ† Technical Implementation

```javascript
// PostHog events to track
posthog.capture('cta_clicked', {
  cta_text: 'Start Automating',
  location: 'hero',
  user_scroll_depth: '25%'
});

posthog.capture('fake_door_started', {
  flow_type: 'automation_builder'
});

posthog.capture('fake_door_completed', {
  task_type: 'data_entry',
  estimated_hours_saved: 10,
  willing_to_pay: 49
});
```

## üìù Copy Changes Needed

### From (Weak):
"Join the Waitlist"

### To (Strong):
- "Start Automating in 2 Minutes"
- "Build Your First Automation Free"
- "See MonkeyDo Work on Your Task"
- "Get Your Monkey Assistant Today"

**Remember**: The goal isn't to get emails. It's to validate that people will PAY for this solution. Every step should move toward that validation.
